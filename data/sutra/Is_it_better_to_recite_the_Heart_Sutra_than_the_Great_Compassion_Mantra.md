Everyone has read the Heart Sutra, and many people can recite it by heart. However, it seems that there are still many people who recite the sutra like the little monk, or they do not fully understand the meaning of the sutra. If you do not understand the meaning of the sutra, but just read and recite it, it is also a great merit. However, if you can further understand the meaning of the sutra and then uphold it, that is, read and recite and uphold it, "understanding and practice go hand in hand", this merit will tend to be perfect, which is truly called inconceivable merit.

All dharmas are equal, there is no high or low

The Heart Sutra tells us that all dharmas are "neither born nor destroyed, neither dirty nor clean, neither increasing nor decreasing", all the same, equal, without difference. The Buddha also told Subhuti directly in the Diamond Sutra: "Subhuti! This dharma is equal, there is no high or low." Everything in the world and the world beyond is equal, and the 84,000 dharmas of the world beyond are also equal. All Buddhist scriptures are spoken by the Buddha, equal and one taste, like honey in a bottle, with a sweet taste in the middle and the sides, full of fructose and glucose.

I often hear some people say that this sutra is good, that sutra is not good; this method is superior, that method is inferior. These are all wrong views, not the correct view of Buddhism. Which of the middle school courses is better, geography? Physics? Chinese? They are all good, and they must be studied. They should be treated equally and not be favored over others. To make it easier for everyone to understand, the Buddha often used medicine to compare Buddhism. Which medicine is good? They are all good. Medicine is not expensive or cheap. Every medicine is important and should be placed on the medicine shelf. Do not neglect one.

All Dharmas are equal, and they are wonderful when they are suitable for the occasion

Although all Dharmas are equal, they must be suitable for the occasion and can respond to it. It is good for this practitioner. If you recite the Heart Sutra, you will respond to it and have a response, so the Heart Sutra is the best for you. If you recite the Great Compassion Mantra, it is easy to respond to it and have a response, so the Great Compassion Mantra is the best for you. If you recite Amitabha Buddha, it is easy to respond to it and have a response, so reciting Amitabha Buddha is the best for you. The so-called first Dharma comes from this. Medicine is not expensive or cheap, all medicines are good medicines, and the quality is not determined by the price. Although medicine is not expensive or cheap, only medicine that can cure the disease is good medicine. For example, if you have a cold, this 2 yuan cold medicine can cure your cold, then this cold medicine is a good medicine for you, and the 100 yuan medicine for heart disease is not a good medicine for you. It is the same when reciting any sutra or practicing any method. If you find this sutra effective, you should recite this sutra, and this sutra is your first and best. If you find this method easy to respond to, you should practice this method, and this method is your first and supreme method.

After knowing this, you will understand: why the Buddha said that this sutra is good when he is talking about this sutra, and that sutra is good when he is talking about that sutra. The contents of some sutras are completely contradictory, but this does not hinder the harmony of Buddhism. This is the whole Buddhism. Just like a math teacher should say that learning math is good, and a geography teacher should say that learning geography is good. It seems contradictory, but it is not a hindrance. This is the skillful means of teaching. In addition, due to different levels and understandings, Buddhism calls it different aptitudes, so the content of the lectures is also different. This is due to different standpoints, which are also skillful means of teaching. There is only one purpose, which is to benefit the audience.

"What kind of sutra should be recited for what kind of things?" Generally speaking, if you want to be reborn in the Pure Land or to liberate the souls of the dead, you should recite Amitabha Buddha and the Amitabha Sutra; if you pray for blessings and safety, you should recite the Great Compassion Mantra and the holy name of Guanyin Bodhisattva; if you pray for good health, you should recite the Medicine Buddha Sutra, etc. This is a general statement. From the perspective of the harmony of Buddhism, one Buddha contains all Buddhas, one Dharma contains all Dharmas, one and two, two are one. Therefore, no matter what happens to you? For what purpose? You can recite this sutra or that sutra, and you can achieve this purpose by reciting all sutras. There is one very important thing here, and you should pay attention to it, that is, "dedication". The key lies in dedication, not the sutra. Reciting all Buddha names, reciting all sutras, and even doing a good deed are all merits. Now, what do we use these merits for? To help the dead souls? Or for our own health? To use these merits to help the dead souls, this is the role of "backward dedication".

We can also use this analogy: chanting this Buddha, chanting that Buddha, reciting this sutra, reciting that sutra, is like being a lawyer, an accountant, or a doctor. No matter what you do, in the end, your labor will turn into wealth - salary. This salary is like the merits of our chanting sutras. Now, do we use the wages to buy clothes? Or hats? This is determined by "backward dedication". It can be seen that backward dedication is to use the merits for what.

If you feel that chanting this "sutra" or "mantra" is more accustomed to, more appropriate, or you have been chanting for a while, then you should continue well. It is important to practice in depth, persevere, and be sincere. Now, there are still some people who think that the more words in the sutras they chant, the more merits they will gain. In fact, this is not the case. This is also a misunderstanding in chanting sutras. Reciting all sutras and mantras will bring the same merits, and there is not much difference between good and bad. The key lies in respect and piety.

Enforcing the law means being attached to the Dharma. Clinging to prejudice is not allowed. A said: "Reciting the Heart Sutra has great merits!" B said: "Reciting the Great Compassion Mantra has great merits!" The two sides argued from morning to night, blushing and ears, and there was no clear winner. In the martial arts arena, they may have to draw their swords and fight each other. Why bother! It's all because they don't understand the Dharma. Those who are confused have high and low Dharma, and those who are enlightened have no increase or decrease in Dharma. If you understand the Dharma, how can there be disputes? There are 80,000 Dharmas, and one door can lead to enlightenment. There are 84,000 doors in the Dharma, and you can attain enlightenment by mastering any door. Just one door is enough!
